\section{Graphical models}
A graphical model is a statistical model associated to a graph,
where the nodes of the graph represent random variables and the
edges in the graph encode relationships between the random variables.
Graphical models are an important class of statistical models used
in many applications (see standard textbooks \cite{Lauritzen, Whitaker})
because of their ability to model complex interactions between
many random variables, by specifying
interactions using only local information about connectivity
between the vertices in a graph.

There are two natural ways to specify a graphical model, through 
either conditional independence statements specified by the graph
or via a parametric representation (sometimes called a ``factorization'').
A fundamental question about graphical models is: For what
graphs the parametric representation is equivalent to the
representation by conditional independence statements?
Every distribution which factors according to the graph
satisfies the conditional independence statements implied by the 
graph, so one can ask:  Which distributions satisfy the conditional
independence statements implied by the graph, but do not factor?

Once we specify the types of random variables under consideration
(e.g. discrete random variables or Gaussian random variables) it
is possible to address the questions in the preceding paragraph
using (computational) algebraic geometry.  Indeed, in these cases,
the set of all probability distributions satisfying a family of 
conditional independence constraints is a semialgebraic set.
For discrete random variables, that semialgebraic set is a subset
of the probability simplex, and can be represented by a certain
homogeneous ideal generated by quadrics.  For Gaussian random variables,
this set of distribution corresponds to a semialgebraic subset
of the cone of positive definite matrices.  Similarly,
the parametrized family of probability distributions also
is a semialgebraic set (of the probability simplex for discrete
random variables, and of the cone of positive definite matrices
for Gaussian random variables).  This algebraic perspective
has been studied by many authors \cite{}, and the book \cite{DSS}
has many details.

The Macaulay 2 graphical models package allows the user to compute
the ideals of conditional independence statements for any collection
of conditional independence statements for discrete or Gaussian
random variables.  It also can compute the vanishing ideal of 
a graphical model in these cases.  A number of auxiliary functions
are useful for doing further analyses of graphical models.

To be explicit, consider the directed acyclic graph $G$ with  five
vertices $\{a,b,c,d,e\}$ and edge
set $\{a \to d, b \to d, c \to d, c \to e, d \to e\}$.
The following commands computes the associated conditional
independence ideal for the set of global Markov statements,
$CI_{{\rm global}(G)}$ and 
the vanishing ideal of the gaussian graphical model $I_{G}$.

\begin{verbatim}
Macaulay2, version 1.4

i1 : loadPackage "GraphicalModels";
i2 : G = digraph{{a,{d}},{b,{d}},{c,{d,e}},{d,{e}}} 
o2 = Digraph{a => set {d}   }
             b => set {d}
             c => set {d, e}
             d => set {e}
             e => set {}
i3 : R = gaussianRing G
o3 : PolynomialRing
i11 : vars R
o11 = | s_(a,a) s_(a,b) s_(a,c) s_(a,d) s_(a,e) s_(b,b) s_(b,c) s_(b,d) s_(b,e) s_(c,c) s_(c,d) s_(c,e) s_(d,d) s_(d,e) s_(e,e) |
i4 : I = conditionalIndependenceIdeal(R,globalMarkov(G));
i5 : J = gaussianVanishingIdeal(R);
\end{verbatim}
The graphical models package uses the graphs package and 
and a number of fundamental constructs and relationships 
associated with graphs.  First we create a polynomial ring
for carrying out the computations, which contains the entries of
the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of a jointly normal random vector
as its indeterminates.  The ring encodes information about the
graph, so many functions in the graphical models package use 
use only the ring as input.

For directed acyclic graphs it is known that 
$V(CI_{{\rm global}(G)}) \cap PD_{m}  =  
V(I_{G}) \cap PD_{m}$,
in particular, the set of positive definite matrices
satisfying the conditional independence constraints, equals the
the set of covariance matrices in the image of the parametrization.
Unfortunately, this does not imply that $CI_{{\rm global}(G)} 
=I_{G}$.  In the case of Gaussian random variables, a larger ideal,
the trek ideal $T_{G}$, generated by all subdeterminants of the 
covariance matrix that vanish on the model, and satisfying
$CI_{{\rm global}(G)} \subseteq T_{G} \subseteq
I_{G}$ is sometimes equal to $I_{G}$, which happens for our
graph of interest $G$ in this case.

\begin{verbatim}
i6 : isSubset(I,J)
o6 = true
i7 : I == J
o7 = false
i8 : K = trekIdeal(R,G);
i9 : J == K
o9 = true
\end{verbatim}

Similar computations can also be performed for graphical models
with discrete random variables,
and with other graph families.  The mathematical explanation of
these graphical models and their associated ideals
are explained in the remaining sections.


\section{Computing conditional independence ideals}

\begin{itemize}
\item What do they mean, in general? 
\item  families of CI statements associated to graphs
\item trek separation
\end{itemize}


\section{Computing the vanishing ideal of a model}

\begin{itemize}
\item from parametric representation
\item how does it compare to CI ideal
\item primary decomp.
\end{itemize}




\section{Technical discussion (?) }
This package requires Graphs.m2, as a consequence it can do
computations with graphs whose vertices are not necessarily labeled by
integers.
