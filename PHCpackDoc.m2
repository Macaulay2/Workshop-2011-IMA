    a package for Polynomial Homotopy Continuation
  Description
    Text
      Interfaces the functionality of the software {\tt PHCpack} 
      to solve polynomial systems and perform calculations in
      {\em numerical algebraic geometry}.  The software is available at
      @HREF"http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html"@.
      The site provides source code and its executable versions {\tt phc}.
      The user must have the executable program {\tt phc} available,
      preferably in the executation path.
      
      Below is a simple example using the most popular function, 
      the numerical blackbox solver.
    Example     
      R = QQ[x,y,z]
      system = {y-x^2,z-x^3,x+y+z-1}
      solns = phcSolve(system)
      numSolns = #solns
      solns/print
    Text
      We see that there are three solutions to the above system. 
      In addition, we can obtain diagnostic information 
      about the quality of each solution.    
      Each solution is of type Point: 
    Example
      oneSoln = solns_0
      peek oneSoln
    Text      
      The value of LastT is the end value of the continuation parameter:
      if it equals 1, then the solver reached the end of the path properly.
  Caveat
    {\bf 1.} If you are having trouble installing the package, 
    check whether the path to your PHCpack executable was set correctly. 
    You can check this by typing the following command:
	       
	       options PHCpack 
	       
    If it is wrong, you can update it by putting the absolute path 
    into the {\tt init-PHCpack.m2} file,
    For example, if the executable {\tt phc} is located in C:/cygwin/PHC,
    then the line inside the {\tt init-PHCpack.m2} file will look like this: 
	       
	        "path" => "C:/cygwin/PHC/" .
	       
    Alternately, the path could be set when loading the package 
    using the following command:
     	       
      loadPackage ("PHCpack", 
      Configuration=>{"path"=>"C:/cygwin/PHC/","PHCexe"=>"./phc"}) 

    {\bf 2.} If the package SimpleDoc is not found when 
   installing {\tt PHCpack.m2}, see questions and answers 6, 7, and 8 
   on the Macaulay2 web site.

    phcSolve

  Headline
    a blackbox solver to approximate all complex isolated solutions (invokes "phc -b")
  Usage
    L = phcSolve(S)
  Inputs
    S:List
      containing the polynomials of a square system (as many equations as unknowns).
  Outputs
    L:List 
      containing the solutions of S, each of type Point. 
  Description
    Text
      Suppose we want to compute the numerical solutions to the 
      following system:
    Example
      R = QQ[x,y,z]
      S = {x+y+z-1,x^2+y^2,x+y-z-3}
    Text
      We call PHCpack's blackbox solver:
    Example
      L = phcSolve(S)
    Text
      We see that there are two solutions. Let's take a look at the first one:
    Example
      oneSoln = L_0
      peek oneSoln
    Text
      The solutions are of type Point, defined in @TO NAGtypes@. 
      Each Point comes with diagnostics to help determine how `good' it is.
      For example, {\tt LastT} is the end value of the continuation parameter; 
      if it equals 1, then the solver reached the end of the path properly.
      
    Text
      A brief discussion on the dimension of the system is in place.
      If we try to run:
      --phcSolve(flatten entries mingens I)
      --break
      we get an error. This is because the code does not check 
      for dimension of the system; it checks for number of equations instead. 
	       
      One way to solve problems to make the system and then use only 
      minimal generators of the ideal by using "mingens".	       
      Here is a second system which is square, but has a free variable 
      anyway (x) :
    Example
      I = ideal(y-x^2,z-x^3,x^2-y)
      dim I 
    Text
      The system is not zero-dimensional (there is a free variable!!); 
      but the code does not know that;
      since we have the system is ``square''...
    Example
      system = flatten entries gens I
      vol = mixedVolume(system) -- this returns zero, not so useful
      phcSolve(system) 
    Text
      Thus, if you are not sure if you have a *truly* square 
      (or overdetermined system), that is, if you want to make sure 
      the system is not positive dimensional (underdetermined),
      you can check this by getting rid of the non-minimal generators 
      of the ideal (note: here we use "mingens" which returns a matrix; 
      we could have used "trim" which returns an ideal)

      In case we need slack variables: 
    Example
      dim trim I
    Text
      Also, if the system is overdetermined, then the method inserts 
      slack variables, so it still works:
    Example
      system={y-x^2, z-x^3,x+y+z-1,x+y+ x^3 -1}
      #system > numcols vars R --overdetermined system
      solns =phcSolve(system);
      numSolns = #solns

      A simple example of when to use this function:

      close to zero. 
      Let us compute a square root with a working precision of 64 decimal
      places:

  Description
    Text
      The mixed volume of a polynomial system $S:=\{f_1,\dots,f_n\}$ 
      is defined as follows:
      Let $P_1,\dots,P_n$ be the Newton polytopes of $f_1,\dots,f_n$, i.e., $P_i$ is the convex hull of the exponents of the monomials in the support of $f_i$. 
      The mixed volume of $S$ is 
      $$ \sum_{1\leq h\leq n} \sum_{1\leq i_1\dots\leq i_h\leq n} (-1)^{n-h}V_n(P_{i_1}+\dots+P_{i_h}),
      $$
      where $V_n$ denotes the $n$-dimensional Euclidean volume.
      
      Bernstein's theorem (D. N. Bernstein,{\em  The number of roots of 
      a system of equations}, Functional. Anal. Appl 9 (1975), no. 3, 183-185), 
      a generalization of the classical Bezout's theorem, shows that for 
      a zero-dimensional system, 
      the mixed volume provides an upper bound on the number of complex 
      isolated roots. 
      If the coefficients of the system are sufficiently generic, 
      the mixed volume is a sharp bound. 
    Example
      R = CC[x,y];
      f = { x^3*y^5 + y^2 + x^2*y, x*y + x^2 - 1};
      I=ideal f
      dim I
      degree I
      m = mixedVolume(f) -- counts the number of complex roots in the torus (without zero components)
      (mv,sv) = mixedVolume(f,stableMV=>true)

      A linear homotopy between target T and start S has the form

    the constant in the gamma trick, optional input for trackPaths
  Description
    Text
      The `gamma trick' refers to the following idea:
      
      If the solutions of the start system are regular, 
      then we avoid singular solutions 
      along the paths by multiplying the start system in the homotopy 
      with a random complex constant {\tt gamma}.     
      This option allows the user to give a specific value of this 
      gamma constant.
    Example
      R = CC[x,y]; 
      f = { x^3*y^5 + y^2 + x^2*y, x*y + x^2 - 1};
      (m,q,qsols) = mixedVolume(f,startSystem=>true);

    the degree of the continuation parameter
  Description
    Text
      By default, the homotopy is created with tDegree equal to 2.
      This option allows the user to give another value for tDegree;
      e.g., a linear homotopy between start system q and target system f 
      is of the form (1-t)*q + t*f.
      
      In general, if tDegree is k, then the homotopy is 
      of the form (1-t)^k*q + t^k*f. 
      
      A reason for changing the tDegree would be the following: 
      higher degree homotopies ensure that the system doesn't change as fast in the beginning and the end of the homotopy; 
      that is, they force smaller step sizes in the beginning and end. 
      The default value, 2, is usually sufficient. 
    Example
      R = CC[x,y]; 
      f = { x^3*y^5 + y^2 + x^2*y, x*y + x^2 - 1};

    k:ZZ

  Outputs

      linear polynomials and k slack variables
  Description
    Text
      To compute generic points of a k-dimensional solution set of a
      polynomial system, we add k random linear equations to the system.
    Example
      R = CC[x,y,z];
      f = { x^2 - y, x^3 - z };
      fe1 = phcEmbed(f,1);
      toString fe1
    Text
      The ring in which the original system lives is extended with
      as many slack variables as the dimension provided as the second
      argument k to phcEmbed.  The slack variables start with zz.
      Solutions of the embedded system with
      zero values for the slack variables are candidate generic points.

      If the system on input is overdetermined (there are more equations
      than unknowns), then as many surplus variables are introduced as
      the difference between the number of equations and the number of
      variables.  Surplus variables start with ss.
    Example
      R = CC[x,y,z];
      f = { x^2-y, x^3-z, x*y-z, x*z-y^2 };
      fe1 = phcEmbed(f,1);
      toString fe1
    Text
      In the example above we gave four equations in three unknowns
      and phcEmbed added one surplus variable ss1 and one slack variable zz1.
      Only solutions with zero values for the surplus variable ss1 matter.

      Note that if the system is already polynomial, or in Laurent

      in a list {\tt fSols} of two real and two complex conjugated solutions.
      {\tt realFilter}  selects the two real solutions.
    Example
      R = QQ[x,y]; 
      f = {x^2 + 4*y^2 - 4, 2*y^2 - x}; 
      fSols = phcSolve(f);
      fSols/print
      realSols = realFilter(fSols,1.0e-10)
    Text
      Good values for the tolerance are relative to the accuracy and the 
      condition number of the solution.
      To improve the accuracy of a solution, apply @TO refineSolutions@ 
      to increase working precision.
    Example
      realSols_0#Coordinates_0 --this is the first coordinate of the first solution

    returns solutions with k-th coordinate less than the given tolerance
  Usage
    zeroSols = zeroFilter(sols,k,tol)
  Inputs
    sols:List
      containing the solutions of a polynomial system
    k:ZZ
      index of a coordinate of a solution
    tol:RR
      tolerance on the absolute value of the k-th coordinate
  Outputs
    zeroSols:List
      solutions with k-th coordinate less than the given tolerance
  Description
    Text
      A solution has its k-th coordinate zero when the abs function
      evaluates to a number less than or equal to the given tolerance.
    Example
      R = QQ[x,y];  
      f = { x^3*y^5 + y^2 + x^2*y, x*y + x^2 - 1};
      fSols = phcSolve(f);
      fSols/print
    Text
      There is one solution with zero second coordinate:
    Example
      zeroSols = zeroFilter(fSols,1,1.0e-10);
      zeroSols / print 
    Text
      Here is another system where we filter solutions with `small' 
      first coordinate:
    Example
      f = {x^2+y^2,y*x+x}; 
      fSols = phcSolve(f);
      fSols/print
      zeroSols = zeroFilter(fSols,0,1.0e-10);
      zeroSols/print
    Text
      Good values for the tolerance are relative to the accuracy
      and the condition number of the solution.
      To improve the accuracy of a solution, apply
      @TO refineSolutions@ with a higher working precision.

    returns solutions with coordinate larger than given tolerance
  Usage
    nonZeroSols = nonZeroFilter(sols,k,tol)
  Inputs
    sols:List
      solutions of a polynomial system
    k:ZZ
      index to a coordinate of a solution
    tol:RR
      tolerance on the abs value of the k-th coordinate
  Outputs
    nonZeroSols:List
      solutions with k-th coordinate larger than the given tolerance
  Description
    Text
      A solution has its k-th coordinate non-zero when the abs function
      evaluates to a number greater than the given tolerance.
    Example
      R = QQ[x,y];  
      f = { x^3*y^5 + y^2 + x^2*y, x*y + x^2 - 1};
      fSols = phcSolve(f);

      nonZeroSols = nonZeroFilter(fSols,1,1.0e-10);
      nonZeroSols / print 
    Text
      Here is another system where we filter solutions with `large enough' first coordinate:
    Example
      f = {x^2+y^2,y*x+x}; 
      fSols = phcSolve(f);
      fSols/print
      zeroSols = zeroFilter(fSols,0,1.0e-10);
      zeroSols/print
    Text
      Good values for the tolerance are relative to the accuracy
      and the condition number of the solution.
      To improve the accuracy of a solution, apply
      @TO refineSolutions@ with a higher working precision.
      
      The method returns the complement of the result of @TO zeroFilter@.
