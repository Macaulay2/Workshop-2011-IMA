A list of activities that are required or at least desirable

* (Mike's machine): make sure Singular and Risa/Asir are running on new rMBP
  and that all PD papers are avialable

* Find best algorithms and ideas for absolute PD

* Get examples into a situation where:
  ** they are easy to run
  ** can run them in other systems too
  ** we can easily tell which ones we need to work on to improve
  We should have one subdir for examples?

* Improve 0-dimensional PD (over a frac field)
  ** use as many tricks as possible to reduce to a case with as small dim over base as possible
    This is perhaps the most interesting part!
  ** possibly use rational function interpolation to find these GB's?

* get all of the code running so it is not in disarray
  i.e, for each function in PD.m2:
  ** make sure we like the interface
  ** document it
  ** write tests for it
