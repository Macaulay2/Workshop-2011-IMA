A list of activities that are required or at least desirable

* (Mike's machine): make sure Singular and Risa/Asir are running on new rMBP
  and that all PD papers are avialable

* Find best algorithms and ideas for absolute PD

* Get examples into a situation where:
  ** they are easy to run
  ** can run them in other systems too
  ** we can easily tell which ones we need to work on to improve
  We should have one subdir for examples?

* Improve 0-dimensional PD (over a frac field)
  ** use as many tricks as possible to reduce to a case with as small dim over base as possible
    This is perhaps the most interesting part!
  ** possibly use rational function interpolation to find these GB's?

* get all of the code running so it is not in disarray
  i.e, for each function in PD.m2:
  ** make sure we like the interface
  ** document it and examples
  ** write tests for it

* Homework for 2 Oct 2012:
  put in tests for equidimSplit, to make sure that the intersection of ideals
    is equal to the radical
  put in tests for makeFiberRings, minimalizeOverFrac, factors
  Franzi: get siphon examples organized, easy to create examples
  Frank: clean up stewart-eg.m2 file, put into PD directory
  Mike: first stab at 0-dim min primes, also factorization over towers?
  All: try it out on various examples

* 6 Nov 2012 Notes:
  * looked at stewart-gough example that took ~15 (or actually 30) seconds to splitTower.
    Used the rationalReconstruction and modular gcd code to find the factor in ~1 second.
    TODO: This needs to be put into a function for other situations when the dimension
          is small, since ratRecon is slow for large dimension ideals. (i.e. strategy
          option).  The example is in gbRatRecon.m2.
  * Looked at the siphon example, and how the code in FactorizingGB handled the second
    test.  It finishes with that code, but does not with ours.  Noticed simplifyIdeal
    is a bit slow and needs to be sped up.
  * Other things still to do:  equidimSplitOneStep needs work (also a bit slow).
