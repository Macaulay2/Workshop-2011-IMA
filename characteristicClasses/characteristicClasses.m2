-- Exported functions
----------------------------------------------------------------

-- The package provides the following functions:
-- segreClass:     computes Segre classes of closed subschemes of P^k, or rather the pushforward 
--                 of the total Segre class to the Chow ring of the ambient space
-- segreClassList: does the same as segreClass, but returns a list with coefficients instead of a 
--                 polynomial
-- chernClass:     computes Chern classes of closed subschemes of P^k, or rather the pushforward 
--                 of the total Chern class to the Chow ring of the ambient space
-- chernlassList:  does the same as chernClass, but returns a list with coefficients instead of a 
--                 polynomial
-- All functions have the option ResidualStrategy, which can be "Symbolic" or "Bertini". 
-- The strategy "Symbolic" uses GrÃ¶bner basis computations, the strategy "Bertini" uses numeric 
-- computations carried out by Bertini [2].

     Headline
     	  Degrees of Chern and Segre classes
     Description
     	  Text
	       The package characteristicClasses provides commands to compute the degrees of the Chern and Segre classes of subvarieties and subschemes of projective space. 
	       Equivalently, it computes the pushforward to projective space of the Chern and Segre classes.
	       
	       Let X be an n-dimensional subscheme of projective space P^k. If X is smooth, then by definition the Chern classes of X are the Chern classes c_0(T_X), ..., c_n(T_X) of the tangent bundle T_X. The Chern classes are cycles in the Chow ring of X, i.e., linear combinations of subvarieties of X modulo rational equivalence. For a subvariety V of X, the degree of the cycle [V] is defined as the degree of the variety V. This extends linearly to linear combinations of subvarieties. Computing the degrees of the Chern classes of X is equivalent to computing the pushforward of the Chern classes to the Chow ring of P^k, which is the ring ZZ[H]/(H^{k+1}), with H the hyperplane class. Also by definition, the Segre classes of the projective scheme X are the Segre classes s_0(X,P^k), ..., s_n(X,P^k) of X in P^k. For definition of the concepts used here, see e.g. W. Fulton "Intersection Theory".
	       The functions in this package can have two different kinds of output. The functions chernClass and segreClass give back the pushforward of the total Chern class to the Chow ring of P^k, whereas chernClassList and segreClassList give a list of the degrees of the Chern or Segre classes, respectively. The scheme X can be given as either a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring over a field, or as projective variety.
	       
	       This implementation uses the algorithm given in the  articles "Chern Numbers of Smooth Varieties via Homotopy Continuation and Intersection Theory" (Sandra Di Rocco, David Eklund, Chris Peterson, Andrew J. Sommese) and "A method to compute Segre classes" (David Eklund, Christine Jost, Chris Peterson).
	       The main step in the algorithm is the computation of the residuals. This can be done symbolically, using
	       Gr&ouml;bner bases, and numerically, using the regenerative cascade implemented in Bertini. The regenerative
	       cascade is described in "Regenerative cascade homotopies for solving polynomial systems" by 
	       Jonathan Hauenstein, Andrew Sommese, and Charles Wampler. Bertini is developed
	       by Dan Bates, Jonathan Hauenstein, Andrew Sommese, and Charles Wampler.

	       For an n-dimensional subscheme X of projective space P^k, this command computes the push-forward of the total Segre class of X in P^k to the Chow ring of P^k. The output is a polynomial in the hyperplane class, containing the degrees of the Segre classes s_0(X,P^k),...,s_n(X,P^k) as coefficients.
	  Example

	       segreClass ideal(x^2*y,x*y^2)

     	       We consider two singular curves in P^2, C_1 defined by \{xy=0\} \  and C_2 defined by \{x^2y=xy^2=0\}. The degrees of their Segre classes are s_0(C_1,P^2) = 2, s_1(C_1,P^2)=-4, and s_0(C_2,P^2)=2, s_1(C_2,P^2)=-3. Observe that the two curves have the same underlying space but a different scheme structure, which is detected by the Segre classes. It is also possible to provide the symbol for the hyperplane class in the Chow ring of P^k:
	  Example
	       segreClass( ideal(x*y), symbol t )
	  Text
	       All the examples were done using symbolic computations with Gr\"obner bases. Changing the

     Description
     	  Text
	       The option ResidualStrategy determines which strategy is used to compute the residuals, which
	       is the main step in the computation of the Chern and Segre classes. When choosing the default
	       "Symbolic", Gr\"obner basis methods will be used. The computations can also be done using 
	       the regenerative cascade implemented in Bertini, choosing the option "Bertini" and provided
	       Bertini is @TO2 {"configuring Bertini", "installed and configured"}@.

     Description
     	  Text
	       Using the numeric version of any command in the package characteristicClasses needs >= version 1.3 of Bertini
	       to be installed. Download and installation of Bertini are explained at the @HREF {"http://www.nd.edu/~sommese/bertini/","Bertini homepage"}@.

	       If Bertini cannot be called from the root Path (e.g. / on Unix-based system), you have to tell
	       the package how to find Bertini. When the package is installed, a file called init-characteristicClasses.m2 is created automatically.
     	       On most systems the file is sought in the directory {\tt HOME/.Macaulay2/}, where {\tt HOME} is replaced by 
	       the path to the user's home directory. Under Mac OS X, the file is sought instead in the directory 
	       {\tt  HOME/Library/Application Support/Macaulay2/}. In the file, replace "" in  the line "path" => ""
	       by the path to Bertini in quotation marks, e.g. "path" => "/usr/local/bin/Bertini/". The / at the end is important.
